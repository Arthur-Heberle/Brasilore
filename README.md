## Overview

This project was developed as part of the *Programming Techniques* course at UTFPR Curitiba during the 3rd semester of the Computer Science degree. It is a 2D platformer game written in C++ that applies object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, file handling (save/load system), and game loop mechanics.

The game features:
- **Custom Entities:** Unique game objects with specific behaviors.
- **Environmental Obstacles:** Platforms, traps, and other interactive elements.
- **Basic AI Behavior:** Enemies with simple, rule-based movement.
- **Player Interaction:** Responsive controls and feedback mechanisms.

The project was built using a custom game engine framework designed for educational purposes, emphasizing modular design and code reuse.
