This project was developed as part of the Programming Techniques course at UTFPR Curitiba during the 3rd semester of my Computer Science degree. It is a 2D platformer game written in C++ that applies object-oriented programming concepts, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling (save/load system), and game loop mechanics.

The game features custom entities, environmental obstacles, basic AI behavior, and player interaction. It was built using a custom game engine framework developed for educational purposes and emphasizes modular design and code reuse.
